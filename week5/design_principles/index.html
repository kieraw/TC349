      <h1>Good and Bad Design Principles</h1>
      <h2>1. Chunking</h2>
      <p>Good: <a  href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/lists">http://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/lists</a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>I think BuzzFeed does an excellent job with chunking. Most of their articles contain lists, which are easier to read for a user. People have short attention spans and want their information to be short and sweet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bad: <a  href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/09/searching-for-the-good-life-in-the-bakken-oil-fields/380677/?src=longreads">http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/09/searching-for-the-good-life-in-the-bakken-oil-fields/380677/?src=longreads</a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Here we have a very long story that takes several minutes to read. Usually, people don’t have the time or patience for that. The information is split up into paragraphs and that is it. The paragraphs do not function without the other, so there is no quick read here.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>2. Signal to Noise Ratio</h2>
        <p>Good: <a  href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">http://www.wolframalpha.com/</a></p>
        <ul>
          <li>This computational tool is aesthetically pleasing and displays the information you want in an effective way. Usually, when doing math problems, it computes extra graphs and results, but they’re useful and are appropriately labeled.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bad: <a  href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Does_stock_have_a_low_or_high_risk">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Does_stock_have_a_low_or_high_risk</a></p>
        <ul>
          <li>I think Wiki Answers does a terrible job at displaying information. I have an ad blocker, and even with that there is a ton of irrelevant information, which is completely unrelated to what you’re asking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Hick's Law</h2>
        <p>Good: <a  href="http://45royale.com/company/">http://45royale.com/company/</a></p>
        <ul>
          <li>This website does a good job at lessening the amount of options a user has. It is simple and aesthetically pleasing. The options for the user are clear, and the website can be easily navigated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bad: <a  href="http://www.cnn.com/">http://www.cnn.com/</a></p>
        <ul>
          <li>I think there is too much going on here. There are too many options, videos auto playing, and articles thrown in your face. There appear to be two main menus, each with several options. The sidebars are also too complex.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Ockham’s Razor</h2>
        <p>Good: <a  href="http://pollenlondon.com/">http://pollenlondon.com/</a></p>
        <ul>
          <li>This website is simple, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. The menu options are displayed when you hover over a photo. At the bottom they have your standards for Twitter, Facebook, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bad: <a  href="http://www.rudgwicksteamshow.co.uk/">http://www.rudgwicksteamshow.co.uk/</a></p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is probably one of the worst websites I’ve ever seen. First of all, the menu options are bunched, and don’t show the entire title of the menu. Second, when you hover over the menu, more options appear that don’t go away until you hover over the menu option again. There is also a ton of clustered pictures that make this website more complicated than it has to be.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Mapping</h2>
        <p>Good: <a  href="http://www.netflix.com">http://www.netflix.com</a></p>
        <ul>
          <li>I think Netflix has great controls. Pretty simple: pause, play, next episode, fast forward, etc. It’s also very easy to see an episode list for a show, or pick a specific season for a show. The layout is clear and very user friendly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bad: <a  href="http://www.arngren.net/">http://www.arngren.net/</a></p>
        <ul>
          <li>This website is just a mess. Who could possibly navigate this? It’s clustered and confusing to anyone. No one would know where to click or where to go. Clicking on a number which I assume is a price takes you to an equally convoluted page.</li>
        </ul>
